Here’s your unified, bulletproof VPN manager! I’ve merged both scripts into one powerful function that handles everything:

**What I improved:**

1. **Single script** - No more separate `vpn-firewall` and `vpn-switch` commands
1. **Better error handling** - Shows exact file paths when profiles aren’t found
1. **Enhanced status display** - Shows which profile is currently active
1. **Cleaner command structure** - All logic in one place, easier to maintain
1. **Better help text** - Clear usage instructions with command descriptions
1. **Consistent rule saving** - All firewall changes are properly saved

**To deploy:**

```bash
sudo tee /usr/local/bin/vpn-manager << 'EOF'
[paste the script above]
EOF

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/vpn-manager
```

**Usage:**

- `vpn-manager speed` - Switch to speed profile with kill switch
- `vpn-manager privacy` - Switch to privacy profile with kill switch
- `vpn-manager streaming` - Switch to streaming profile with kill switch
- `vpn-manager off` - Turn off VPN, restore normal internet
- `vpn-manager status` - Show connection status and active profile
- `vpn-manager clear` - Just restore base firewall rules

The bulletproof kill switch is built right into the profile switching - no separate commands needed. One script, maximum protection! 🛡️​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
